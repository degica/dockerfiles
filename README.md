This repository is used to automate building and stashing specific versions of dependencies that our applications rely on. This prevents sudden changes such as

- changes of the base image from bookworm to buster
- supply chain vulnerabilities

that create unexpected breakages in our applications.

# rails-base

rails-base contains common dependencies that our applications use. You can use `public.ecr.aws/degica/rails-base:<version>` to build your rails application.
